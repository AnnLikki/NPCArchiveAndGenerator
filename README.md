# NPCArchiveAndGenerator
 
A note about the name:
Despite the fact that the program is called "NPC Archive & Generator", there is no random character generation functionality yet. I have been creating the project with plans for the future, and I want to add this functionality later.

# Description
This program is an interactive archive of NPCs (non-player characters). It allows you to store and edit the data of the characters of table top role-playing games (TTRPGs), providing a structured and detailed user interface for recording their data. Also, the program provides an interactive archive of races that these non-player characters may represent.

# Functionality
1. View the archive of characters.
2. Creating, editing and deleting characters from the archive.
3. Automatic calculation of character characteristics modifiers.
4. Automatic calculation of the biological (human) age of the character based on his chronological age and vice versa.
5. Viewing the archive of races.
6. Creating, editing and deleting races from the archive.
7. Saving, importing and exporting archives in JSON format.
# Planned functionality
1. Search and filter archives through the input field.
2. Changing the order in which archive items are displayed.
3. Adding icons to archive items.
4. Adding pictures, files and hyperlinks to character notes.
5. Character generation by linking editable "small archives" to races and characters themselves, storing lists of various data that can be used in generation.

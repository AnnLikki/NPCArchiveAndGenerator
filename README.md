# NPC Archive & Generator
## Overview
This program is a deeply customizable generator and archive of NPCs (non-player characters) for TTRPGs. It is useful for fantasy world-builders or Game Masters running their campaigns, and it provides a way to create and set up character generators tailored to your specific needs.

## Functionality

- Store generated or hand-made characters in the NPC archive with structured fields about the NPC, D&D-based ability scores and notes.
- Create highly customizable bundles (layered lists of resources) that are used in races and archetypes to generate complex gender and age-based results.
- Set up custom races in the Race archive by configuring their age, gender and default bundles chances.
- Create archetypes for generating characters, as specific or as broad as you need. Customize everything: age ranges, genders, races, bundles and their probabilities of generation. Use these archetypes to quickly generate new NPCs or fill the gaps in already created ones. 

## Planned functionality

The app is still in the development, so a lot of exciting features are planned to be added:
- Powerful tools for NPC archive organization: tags, groups, and more.
- Ability to add images and files to NPCs.
- Linking characters together to create custom relationships.
- Entity export for exchanging data between archives and users.
- Generation straight from a bundle without a need for an archetype.
